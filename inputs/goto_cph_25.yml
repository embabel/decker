  Rod Johnson, Embabel. Creator of Spring and Embabel

brief: >

  Ideas for the flow:

  Gen AI is amazing. show cool examples for personal use, 
  personal assistant use case
  Show failure statistics on agent projects in business, recent MIT gartner etc and with quotes
  Diagnose causes for this: 
  - Technology is nondeterministic, it's slow and expensive to run, 
  - things change all the time, 
  - best practice is emerging: 
  - it's not integrated with bsuiness, it's coming out of a diffferent team, Python frameworks aren't aligned with business, 
  - it's excessively vendor driven, vendors selling snake oil

  How do we fix this? Firstly we attack the nondeterminism and make agents as predictable as possible. Second we seek ways to integrate with what already works and not imagine we can reinvent the world

  What is the role of Java developers?

  We could imitate the Python world and copy their approaches. That approach is doomed to failure and if that's the best we can do (a) I'm very worried about the future and (b) go learn Python (you should know it anyway).

  Or we could do more than play catchup. We could bring our assets to a far superior approach

  The future of Gen AI for business is substantially on the JVM.

  Embabel is a framework that attacks every one of these challenges
  - Unique innovative planning element that is smart but deterministic. Actions/Goals allow an extensible system better than FSM of LangGraph or Crew AI but will always do the same thing
  - Emphasis on strong typing and tooling
  - Brings structure to LLM interactions vs just text (consider Embabel vs Python Crew AI examples)
  - Ability to mix code actions and LLM invocation seamlessly for the maximum predictability possible (because of structure)
  - Emphasis on domain modelling  and potential to integrate with what's already there
  - Builds on Spring for easy adoption in Java
  - Lovely modern API in Java or Kotlin
  - Highly testable

  Once more the Java community can do with Spring and open source did in 
  taking back control from vendors and demonstrating what works
  
  As an example of Embabel's power, this slide deck was built by Embabel.
  The Decker agent illustrates the core ideas. Show example of how
  Agents and Goals and AchievesGoal work from this project.
  
  Conclusion:

  You could go with vendor snake oil or start from scratch 
  with an unimaginative python framework. Massive risk. 
  Or try Embabel, the best agent framework anywhere.
