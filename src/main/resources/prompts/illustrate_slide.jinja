Consider the following slide in MARP format.
The content is inside
<slide/> tags.

This slide sits as part of a presentation with the following content:
{{ presentationRequest.brief }}

If the slide contains an HTML comment like this:
<!-- ILLUSTRATE: big house -->

Add an image to this slide IF IT WILL MAKE AN IMPACT
AND MAKE THE POINT CLEARER.

DO NOT USE AN IMAGE UNLESS YOU CAN FIND ONE THAT IS
DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE POINT

Check that the image is available.
Format it so that you don't make the image too big.
Put the image on the right.
Make no other changes.
Do not perform any web research besides seeking images.
Return nothing but the amended slide content (the content between
<slide></slide>).
Do not include
<slide/>
tags
If you don't think an image is needed, return the slide unchanged.

Formatting instructions:
Use this formula with a div, a class of "columns-left" and the image after the div.

<!-- _class: columns-left -->
<div>
    ...text content of the slide
</div>
![alt text](image_url)

Heres' the content:
<slide>
    {{ slideContent }}
</slide>
